# Student Performance Analysis
firstly, i cleaned data, then visually represent and summarise data. then try to find which factor and how effcts student performance and with how much intensity.
found out all the correlation factors and tried to visually represent it . got distribution of gender which almost balanced . found out the health report of students and how it affects student marks . created a column named avg garde which compute avg marks of all examination.
we got that most affecting factors of student grade is going out. so we should inform parents about it.
we found that both schools are almost same in terms of grade.
there is a little bit bias in gender like male students are performing good compratively.

tech stack used:

Pandas: data cleaning ,
